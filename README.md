- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander Schperberg (@AlexS28), a PhD student at the Robotics and Mechansisms Laboratory, headed by Professor Dennis Hong.
- 👀 I’m interested in Locomotion, Manipulation, Controls, Estimation, and Planning for Robotic Systems - from wheeled and aerial robots to legged robots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reinforcement learning and visual mapping using point clouds, towards the planning and control of a complex climbing robot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with anyone interested in planning/control of climbing robots, or state estimation using vision.
